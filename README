What is Gbonds
==============

Gbonds is a program for maintaining inventories of U.S. Savings Bonds for
the GNOME desktop environment.  It allows you to track the current redemption
value and performance of your bonds.

Gbonds is similar in functionality to "Savings Bond Wizard[TM]" program
distributed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  Gbonds can import
inventories created by the Savings Bond Wizard.

LIBGNOMEUI-2.2.x
