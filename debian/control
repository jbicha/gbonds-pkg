Description: U.S. savings bond inventory program for GNOME
 GBonds is a savings bond inventory program for the GNOME desktop environment.
 It allows you to track the current redemption value and performance of your
 U.S. Savings Bonds and keep a valuable record of the bonds you own. GBonds is
 similar in functionality to Savings Bond Wizard from the U.S. Department of
 the Treasury.
 .
 Features:
 .
   * Tracks savings notes and series E, EE, and I savings bonds.
   * Uses U.S. Treasury Department redemption files without modification.
   * Imports inventories created with Savings Bond Wizard.
   * Tracks current value of both individual bonds and an entire inventory.
   * Prints inventories. It is important to keep a permanent record of your
     bonds in a separate location if you ever need to replace them.
