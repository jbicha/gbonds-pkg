Description: Upstream changes introduced in version 2.0.3-1
 This patch has been created by dpkg-source during the package build.
 Here's the last changelog entry, hopefully it gives details on why
 those changes were made:
 .
 gbonds (2.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * New upstream version
   * Remove the Encoding key from the gbonds.desktop file as it is deprecated
   * Change debian/copyright to the DEP5 machine-readable format
   * Document the upstream copyright years in debian/copyright
   * Document the existence of public domain files in debian/copyright
   * Add a Homepage field to debian/control
   * Removed snaught.com from the download list, as it didn't have the latest
     redemption data.  This leaves only the official U.S. Treasury FTP site.
   * Split the arch-indep data out into gbonds-data.
   * Update the standards version to 3.8.4
   * Switch to debhelper 7 with a minimal rules file
   * Switch to source format "3.0 (quilt)"
   * Rerun the autotools because ltmain.sh is ancient
   * Added savings bond redemption data through 11/2010 (sb201006.asc)
   * Disabled printing, as libgnomeprint is going away (Closes: 542565)
 .
